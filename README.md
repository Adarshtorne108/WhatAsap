WhatASap

A WhatsApp-like chatting web-application and app. 
The front-end of the app was developed using `flutter`.
The directory:
- `flutter` contains the code for the front-end of the app,
- `WebContent` contains the required `javascript/css` files for your web application, and
- `my_src` contains the code for the back-end

However, for the purpose of separate grading of front-end and back-end in the project, servlets in `sample_src` (provided as part of the project) were used by the front-end code in the web-application and the app.
